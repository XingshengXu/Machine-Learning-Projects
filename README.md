## Introduction
The "Machine Learning Projects" repository is a collection of various projects that showcase the machine learning algorithms behind each model and the application of these models to real-world problems. Each project in the repository is designed to provide a hands-on experience for individuals looking to explore the field of machine learning. The projects cover a wide range of models, from simple regression analysis to complex deep learning networks, providing a comprehensive overview of the field.

The repository is organized in a way that makes it easy for users to understand the code and the methodology used. Each project includes a main code file (.py) that contains the core algorithms for the model, written in an Object-Oriented Programming format. Additionally, a demo file (.ipynb) details the usage and results of running each model on different sets of data, and sometimes a utils file is included that contains utility functions used in the main code file. The code is well-commented and includes docstrings, making it easy to follow and suitable for individuals at all levels of experience, from beginners to advanced users.

Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or simply interested in the field, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to expand their knowledge and build their portfolio. So, dive in and start exploring the world of machine learning!
