## Introduction
The "Machine Learning Projects" repository is a collection of various projects that showcase the machine learning algorithms behind each model and the application of these models to real-world problems. Each project in the repository is designed to provide a hands-on experience for individuals looking to explore the field of machine learning. The projects cover a wide range of models, from simple regression analysis to complex deep learning networks, providing a comprehensive overview of the field.

The repository is organized in a way that makes it easy for users to understand the code and the methodology used. Each project includes a main code file (.py) that contains the core algorithms for the model, written in an Object-Oriented Programming format. Additionally, a demo file (.ipynb) details the usage and results of running each model on different sets of data, and sometimes a utils file is included that contains utility functions used in the main code file. The code is well-commented and includes docstrings, making it easy to follow and suitable for individuals at all levels of experience, from beginners to advanced users.

Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or simply interested in the field, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to expand their knowledge and build their portfolio. So, dive in and start exploring the world of machine learning!

## Technical Requirements
* **Programming Language**: Python 3.11 (compatible with future versions)
* **Third-Party Libraries**: Minimal, mostly for data pre-processing and visualization. All the required libraries/packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
* **External Dependencies**: None, all datasets are included within the repository.
* **Hardware Requirements**: CPU sufficient, as the models are lightweight and use small datasets for demonstration and educational purposes.

## Installation and Setup Guide
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XingshengXu/Machine-Learing-Projects.git
```
### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment
Navigate to the project folder and create a virtual environment using the following command:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate the virtual environment (Optional but recommended):
* On Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
* On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the cloned repository and install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code
Each project within this repository has its own dedicated folder, which generally includes:

* **model_name.py**: Core algorithms written in an object-oriented format.
* **model_demo.ipynb**: Demo codes to help you get started and see the model in action.
* **utils.py**: Helper functions.
* **plots**: A folder containing plots and animations.
To run a model, navigate to its folder and open the demo.ipynb Jupyter notebook. This will provide an interactive way to understand the model and its outputs.
